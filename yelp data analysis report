Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id-pk)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id-fk)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id-fk)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id-fk)
v. Review = 10000(id-pk)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id-fk)
vii. Photo = 10000(id-pk)
viii. Tip = 3979(business_id-fk)
ix. User = 10000(id-pk)
x. Friend = 11(user_id-fk)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id-fk)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	No, not really for instance yuri have given 1339 reviews and got very low fans when compared with mimi who had given 968 reviews with fan following of 497.
	so , number of fans is not directly correlated with posing of more reviews.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

  For this analysis purpose I have chosen city ='TORONTO' and category ='RESTAURANTS'.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

after brief analysis we can easily intrepret there are certain restaurants which has highest of ratings functions on evening to midnight from 14:00 - 2:00
for example - Cabin fever (4.5).
other than that there is not any big difference in distribution of hours in both the groups for instance , the restaurant 'Sushi Osaka' which has the ratings of 4.5 functions on the same hours as '99 Cent Sushi' restaurant whereas it was rated as 2.0 stars, so they don't seem to have much of difference when comes to distribution of hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
        
YES, as we interpret the results from the below table we can easily conclude that the 2 groups have different number of reviews. for example the group with 2-3 stars have total of only 86 reviews , whereas the restaurants from the group 4-5 have 206 reviews collectively.


+---------+--------------------+-------------+-------+--------------+
| city    | name               | category    | stars | review_count |
+---------+--------------------+-------------+-------+--------------+
| Toronto | Cabin Fever        | Restaurants |   4.5 |           26 |
| Toronto | Sushi Osaka        | Restaurants |   4.5 |            8 |
| Toronto | Mama Mia           | Restaurants |   4.0 |            8 |
| Toronto | Naniwa-Taro        | Restaurants |   4.0 |           75 |
| Toronto | Edulis             | Restaurants |   4.0 |           89 |
| Toronto | Big Smoke Burger   | Restaurants |   3.0 |           47 |
| Toronto | Pizzaiolo          | Restaurants |   3.0 |           34 |
| Toronto | 99 Cent Sushi      | Restaurants |   2.0 |            5 |

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

NO , since the location data ectracted from the query for the 2 groups remains ambigious and doesn't have any pattern to classify hence we can't able to infer anything from thetwo groups location data.

SQL code used for analysis:

(i)
select name ,category,city,state,stars,review_count
from category join business on business.id = category.business_id
where is_open=1
order by review_count desc ;

select name ,category,city,state,stars,review_count
from category join business on business.id = category.business_id
where is_open=0
order by review_count desc ;


(ii)
select sum(review_count) as tot_reviews,is_open
from business
group by is_open

select name ,category,city,state,stars
from category join business on business.id = category.business_id
where is_open=1

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         predicting the overall star rating for a business
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

The data required for this analysis is extracted from business table and the required attributes are stars and name of respective businesses, for this prediction we have deployed a sum function over stars and grouped them based on the name of businesses. from our prediction starbucks tops the table with the cumulative sum of 166.5 stars overall followed by Subway (137.5) and McDonald's (89.5)
